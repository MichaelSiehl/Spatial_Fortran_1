# General Purpose Data Flow (Spatial) Programming for FPGAs Using Coarray Fortran (as yet only emulated on CPUs): 1. Defining Some Basics

I open this repository to initially define and describe some basic spatial programming techniques using Coarray Fortran (2018).

*Note: The contents herein are ongoing work and preliminary. Contents may certainly contain mistakes and errors, I do make a number of assumptions and best guesses herein. As yet, all parallel programming here does work efficiently on a CPU and it is only assumed that the same programming will work on FPGAs. **Fortran would then allow to use the same programming for both CPUs and FPGAs.** This work does still describe programming for FPGAs, and even if the Fortran codes are the same for CPUs, describing these codes for programming on CPUs would be very differently.<br />
Some familiarity with Coarray Fortran as well as with spatial programming concepts (as initially described for DPC++) may be required for the reader to be able to follow with the contents here. For links to resources see the section ‘Prerequisites’ at the end.*
